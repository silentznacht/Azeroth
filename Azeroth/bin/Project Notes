How rendering works?

Rendering is when pixel lands on a number (y) and creating an entire range at that numbers position(x).
Much like a pixel landing at 108(y) and then creating an entire range for 108(x)
In our code the render has a limit for the pixel number, which would be 256.

What are ticks used for? 

Ticks are widely used in gane development as a measurment of time to explain how one instance is repeated including also being used as a unit of system internal time as well. In our program it is currently being used to show fps.
